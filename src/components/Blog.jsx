                        Controlled and uncontrolled components refer to how the component's
                        data is managed and updated. With an uncontrolled component, the
                        data is managed by the browser, which means that the component's
                        data is handled by the DOM directly, rather than by React. This can
                        make them simpler to implement and require less code. On the other
                        hand, with a controlled component, the data is managed by React
                        through state or props, which allows for more precise control over
                        the component's behavior. Controlled components are typically used
                        for more complex forms that require validation or other constraints,
                        while uncontrolled components are often used for simple forms.

                        How to validate React props using PropTypes.

                        PropTypes is a library built into React that allows us to validate
                        the types of props that are passed to a component. This can be
                        helpful for catching errors early on and ensuring that our
                        components are being used correctly. To use PropTypes, we first need
                        to import it from the 'prop-types' package. Then, we can define the
                        expected types for each prop in our component using the PropTypes
                        library. We can specify a number of different types, including
                        strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. To validate
                        props, we simply add a 'propTypes' property to our component and
                        define the expected types for each prop. If a prop is passed to the
                        component that does not match the expected type, an error will be
                        thrown in the console.

                        Node.js and Express.js are both JavaScript-based technologies that
                        are commonly used for web development. However, that serve different
                        purposes and have distinct features. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime
                        environment that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of a web
                        browser. It provides a set of APIs for building network
                        applications, file systems, and other system-level tasks. Node.js
                        can be used to build a variety of applications, including
                        server-side web applications, command-line tools, and desktop
                        applications. Express.js, on the other hand, is a web application
                        framework built on top of Node.js. It provides a set of features and
                        tools for building web applications, such as routing, middleware,
                        and template engines. Express.js is often used to build server-side
                        web applications that use Node.js as the backend. In summary,
                        Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that can be used for a
                        variety of tasks, including building web applications, while
                        Express.js is a web application framework built on top of Node.js
                        that provides additional features and tools for building server-side
                        web applications.

                        A custom hook in React is a function that allows us to reuse
                        stateful logic across multiple components. By creating a custom
                        hook, we can extract the common logic from your components and reuse
                        it in a more modular and reusable way. Custom hooks are a powerful
                        tool for code reuse and can help to keep our code more organized and
                        maintainable. Custom hooks are created by defining a function that
                        uses React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and
                        others. The function should return an object or an array with the
                        stateful values and functions that we want to use in our component.
                        There are many reasons why we might want to create a custom hook.
                        For example, we might have some complex logic that is used across
                        multiple components, or we might want to abstract away some common
                        functionality such as handling form data or fetching data from an
                        API. Custom hooks can also help to simplify our components and
                        reduce the amount of boilerplate code that we need to write.
                        Overall, creating a custom hook in React can help us to improve code
                        reuse, maintainability, and organization, and can make our
                        components more modular and easier to understand.
